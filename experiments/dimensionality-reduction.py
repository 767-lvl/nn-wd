# Reduce dimensionality proof of concept (ie: use t-SNE library)

# Reduce dimensionality to a colour space (ie: 3-dimensions for RGB)
# TODO

# Reduce dimensionality by maximizing the range, still in the colour space.
# TODO

# Reduce dimensionality by fixing 2 endpoints and then maintaining as best as possible a set of mathematical relations.
